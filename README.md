Bristol
=======

The first [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io) event in Bristol!

We'll be going through the choose-your-own-adventure style lessons on [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io).

You'll use the terminal/command line to begin learning [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node is a great way to get into full-stack JavaScript development.

You'll also have the opportunity to use nodeschool.io to learn Git, JavaScript and other useful technologies. There will be stickers for completing workshops! 
We'll take you through installation if necessary, but if you feel confident enough to install Node yourself and you already have a text-editor then that would be great.
